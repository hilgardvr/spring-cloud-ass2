Again, Use Netbeans and JDK. I tried Eclipse and it did not work. See https://www.coursera.org/learn/cloud-services-java-spring-framework/discussions/weeks/4/threads/IyzTytWeEemKlBI5VhN_cg
It is not necessary to use Spring Data Rest.
Focus on week 4 lectures (videos 1, 2, 3, 5)
If you need to return an error (404 etc) then you do response.sendError(...) but you also need to `return null` for the response body
It is confusing to see Oauth2 mentioned. It is not required at all for the assignment except in the instruction for Application.java
